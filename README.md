Ore Rush is a two-dimensional turn based multiplayer strategy Game.
<br/>
The game board consists of a 15x30 field where the 5 different ore types

The player can set up special items like radars or traps.
<br/>
The Goal is to win the Game by gaining more points than the opposing Players.
<br/>

## Built With

The following libraries are used:

* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

## Getting Started

To get started all you have to do is [install gradle](https://gradle.org/) and use gradle to build the cloned repository.
Once you build the game there are some parameters.

### Prerequisites

There is, currently, no need for external software to play this game!

### Installation

1. Install gradle apt-get install gradle Or sdk install gradle 7.4.1

2. [clone](https://git.scicore.unibas.ch/cs108-fs22/Gruppe-12.git) the git repository

3. build the project using gradle

4. launch the game


## Usage

When the game is launched there will be multiple possible lobbies to connect to. Once a lobby is selected there will be a lobby-chat system that allows the user to chat with all the different users in said lobby. If you are the first person in the lobby you will become host and should change all the relevant settings there are.
Once playing you will have control over multiple robots, these are controlled by clicking on them and interacting with the action bar that opens up once clicked.
